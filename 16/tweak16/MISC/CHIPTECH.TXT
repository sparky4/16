  Bank Switching:

   Bank switching is dependent on Chip version:

			      16 color modes       256 color modes
   Chip         #bank regs   #Banks Granularity   #banks Granularity
   82c451/5/6      1                                  4    64Kbytes

   82c453          2           256     1Kbytes      256     4Kbytes

    For the 82c452 & 3  the window to display memory can start on
    any boundary fitting the granularity of the chip/display mode.
    When using 2 bankregisters, the address range available to the
    adapter is split equally between the two bank registers. I.e.
    A000h-A7FFh uses one bank, and A800h-AFFFh the other.
    (Or A000h-AFFFh and B000h-BFFFh respectively if using the full
    128 Kbytes range).
