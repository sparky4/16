MODULE  XCLIPPBM   note: VERY SIMILAR to XPBMCLIP
This module implements blits of clipped planar bitmaps.  Blits are
clipped to pixels, both horizontally.  This makes the unmasked blit
function here slightly slower than the equivalent functions in the
XPBMCLIP module.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
								 XCLIPPBM:
							 Blits and Pieces
						   by Matthew MacKenzie

The XCLIPPBM module contains clipping versions of two of the three routines
in the XPBITMAP module:
  o  x_clip_pbm transfers a planar bitmap to the screen, clipping off any
	 part outside a bounding box.
  o  x_clip_masked_pbm does the same thing, but transfers only nonzero
	 pixels.

	The planar bitmap format is described elsewhere.  Here we will look at
the clipping itself, since it is the only distinguishing feature of this
module.
	The bounding box is made up of four integers, TopBound, BottomBound,
LeftBound, and RightBound.  Unlike most global variables in Xlib, these are
meant to be written to.  In fact, they start out uninitialized.  Be sure to
set them before you try plotting any clipped bitmaps.
	Note that these are not the same variables which are used in the other
clipping modules in Xlib.  This is because the two systems are incompatible:
the other modules clip horizontally to columns while this one clips to
pixels.  As you might have guessed, those functions and these were developed
in different hemispheres of the planet...
	If it's any consolation, this does give you two independent
bounding boxes to futz with, should the mood visit you.
	Bitmaps cannot go outside the perimeter of the bounding box, but they
can overlap it.  If TopBound equals BottomBound, for example, a horizontal
slice of a bitmap may still be plotted.  It is safe to turn the box "inside
out" to make sure nothing will be plotted -- this is the first thing each
routine checks for.
	To plot a bitmap, minus its zero pixels, minus anything outside the
bounding box:

x_clip_masked_pbm (int X, int Y, int ScreenOffs, char far * Bitmap);

	The arguments are in the same order as those for x_put_masked_pbm in
the module XPBITMAP.  The bounding box is relative to the given
ScreenOffs(et).  This lets you perform page flipping without worrying about
what screen you are clipping to -- it's always the current screen.  The
bitmap itself, of course, is not affected; clipping is performed on-the-
fly.  Both functions return an integer which indicates whether any part
of the bitmap was inside the bounding box.  If the entire bitmap was
outside, a 1 is returned; otherwise, a 0.
	The third function in XPBITMAP, for which this module has no
equivalent, copies from video RAM to system RAM.  The absence of such a
routine may seem at first like a disadvantage -- but this, like so many
things in this life, is an illusion.  You can use the unclipped routine,
and clip the bitmap when you want to plot it back onto the screen.

  x_clip_pbm
  ----------
  C Prototype: extern int x_clip_pbm (int X, int Y, int ScreenOffs, char
									   far * Bitmap);

  Copies a planar bitmap from SRAM to VRAM, with clipping.  If the entire
  bitmap turns out to be outside the bounding box, this function returns
  a 1; otherwise it returns a 0.

  x_clip_masked_pbm
  -----------------
  C Prototype: extern int x_clip_masked_pbm (int X, int Y,
								   int ScreenOffs, char far * Bitmap);

  Copies a planar bitmap from SRAM to VRAM, with clipping -- 0 bytes
  in the bitmap are not copied.  If the entire bitmap turns out to be
  outside the bounding box, this function returns a 1; otherwise,
  it returns a 0.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
MODULE  XMOUSE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
The XMOUSE module implements very basic mouse handling functions. The way
in which it operates is by installing an event handler function during
initialization which subsequently intercepts and processes mouse events and
automatically updates status variables such as mouse position and button
pressed status. It does not support the full functionality of:

  SPLIT SCREENS
  SCROLLED WINDOWS
  VIRTUAL WINDOWS

This was done to primarily prevent unecessary impedences to performance,
since the mouse handler function has the potential to degrade performance.
It also saves me alot of coding which I was too lazy to do.

Programs communicate with the mouse driver as with other devices, through
an interrupt vector namely 33h. On generating an interrupt, the mouse driver
expects a function number in AX and possibly other parameters in other
registers and returns information via the registers. A brief description
of the mouse functions follows:

	      Mouse Initialization                 0
	      Show Cursor                          1
	      Hide Cursor                          2
	      Get Mouse Position & Button Status   3
	      Set Mouse Cursor Position            4
	      Get Button Press Information         5
	      Get Button Release Information       6
	      Set Min/Max Horizontal Position      7
	      Set Min/Max Vertical Position        8
	      Define Graphics Cursor Block         9
	      Define Text Cursor                  10
	      Read Mouse Motion Counters          11
	      Define Event Handler                12

	      Light Pen Emulation Mode OFF        14
	      Set Mouse Mickey/Pixel Ratio        15
	      Conditional Hide Cursor             16
	      Set Double-Speed Threshold          19
	      --------------------------------------

In practice only afew of these functions are used and even fewer when the
mouse status is monitored by an event handler function such as is used in
this module.

The most important thing to note when using the mouse module is that the
mouse event handler must be removed before exiting the program. It is a good
idea to have an exit function (see the C "atexit" function) and include the
line "x_mouse_remove();" along with any other pre-exit cleanup code.

  EXPORTED FUNCTIONS

  x_mouse_init
  ------------

    C Prototype:  int x_mouse_init()

  Initialize the mouse driver functions and install the mouse event handler
  function. This is the first function you must call before using any of the
  mouse functions. This mouse code uses the fastest possible techniques to
  save and restore mouse backgrounds and to draw the mouse cursor.

  WARNING: This function uses and updates "NonVisual_Offset" to allocate
	   video ram for the saved mouse background.

  LIMITATIONS: No clipping is supported horizontally for the mouse cursor
	       No validity checking is performed for NonVisual_Offs

  **WARNING** You must Hide or at least Freeze the mouse cursor while drawing
	      using any of the other XLIB modules since the mouse handler may
	      modify vga register settings at any time. VGA register settings
	      are not preserved which will result in unpredictable drawing
	      behavior. If you know the drawing will occur away from the
	      mouse cursor set MouseFrozen to TRUE (1), do your drawing
	      then set it to FALSE (0). Alternatively call "x_hide_mouse",
	      perform your drawing and then call "x_show_mouse". Another
	      alternative is to disable interrupts while drawing but usually
	      drawing takes up alot of time and having interrupts disabled
	      for too long is not a good idea.

  x_define_mouse_cursor
  ---------------------

  C Prototype:
    void x_define_mouse_cursor(char far *MouseDef, unsigned char MouseColor)

    MouseDef - a pointer to 14 characters containing a bitmask for all the
	       cursor's rows.
    MouseColor - The colour to use when drawing the mouse cursor.

  Define a mouse cursor shape for use in subsequent cursor redraws. XMouse
  has a hardwired mouse cursor size of 8 pixels across by 14 pixels down.

  WARNING: This function assumes MouseDef points to 14 bytes.

  Note: Bit order is in reverse. ie bit 7 represents pixel 0 ..
	bit 0 represents pixel 7 in each "MouseDef" byte.

  x_show_mouse
  ------------

  C Prototype:  void x_show_mouse()

  Makes the cursor visible if it was previously hidden.
  See Also: "x_hide_mouse".

  x_hide_mouse
  ------------

  C Prototype:  void x_hide_mouse()

  Makes the cursor hidden if it was previously visible.
  See Also: "x_show_mouse".

  x_remove_mouse
  --------------

  C Prototype:  void x_remove_mouse()

  Stop mouse event handling and remove the mouse handler.

  NOTE: This function MUST be called before quitting the program if
       a mouse handler has been installed

  x_position_mouse
  ----------------

  C Prototype  void x_position_mouse(int x, int y)

  Positions the mouse cursor at the specified location

  x_update_mouse
  --------------

  C Prototype:  void x_update_mouse()

  Forces the mouse position to be updated and cursor to be redrawn.
  Note: this function is useful when you have set "MouseFrozen" to true.
  Allows the cursor position to be updated manually rather than
  automatically by the installed handler.

MODULE  XCIRCLE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
				XCIRCLE:
		      Wheel Have to See About That
			 by Matthew MacKenzie

The XCIRCLE module contains two functions, neither of which should be
a big mystery:
  o  x_circle, oddly enough, draws a circle.
  o  x_filled_circle does too, only the circle is filled (in some
     libraries this is called a disc).

	The word `circle' here refers to a round thing which is as many
pixels tall as across.  It only looks like a circle in 320x240 mode --
the original mode X -- and in 376x282 mode.
    In both functions, the circle is specified by the coordinates of the
upper-left-hand corner of the smallest box which holds it, and the
diameter.  Some circle functions have you specify a center point;
this system is kind of odd because a circle with an even diameter does
not have a particular pixel for a center.  Every circle, on the other
hand, has a box with an upper-left corner.
    No bounds are checked.  A diameter of zero will draw nothing, and
a negative diameter will blow your VGA board into hundreds of thousands
of tiny little smoldering fragments.  Neither function supports clipping.
    The calculation of the circle is based on an algorithm described
by Michael P. Lindner in a letter to the editor on page 8 of Dr. Dobb's
Journal #169 (October 1990).  The algorithm has been rearranged to
allow drawing and moving the plots in the eight octants to be performed
in one step, so that each pixel does not have to be loaded into the CPU
twice.  x_filled_circle does not take advantage of this optimization
because it handles different parts of each plot at different times.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
MODULE XRLETOOL
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

This module implements a number of functions comprising an RLE encoding
decoding system.

RLE stands for RUN LENGTH ENCODING. It is a quick simple data compression
scheme which is commonly used for image data compression or compression
of any data. Although not the most efficient system, it is fast, which is
why it is used in image storage systems like PCX. This implementation is
more efficient than the one used in PCX files because it uses 1 bit to
identify a Run Length byte as opposed to two in PCX files, but more on this
later.

This set of functions can be used to implement your own compressed image
file format or for example compress game mapse for various levels etc.
The uses are limited by your imagination.

I opted for trading off PCX RLE compatibility for the improved compression
efficiency.

Here is how the data is un-compressed to give an idea of its structure.


STEP 1 read a byte from the RLE compressed source buffer.

STEP 2 if has its high bit is set then the lower 7 bits represent the number
       of times the next byte is to be repeated in the destination buffer.
       if the count (lower 7 bits) is zero then
	  we have finished decoding goto STEP 5
       else goto STEP 4

STEP 3 Read a data from the source buffer and copy it directly to the
       destination buffer.
       goto STEP 1

STEP 4 Read a data byte from the source buffer and copy it to the destination
       buffer the number of times specified by step 2.
       goto STEP 1

STEP 5 Stop, decoding done.

If the byte does not have the high bit set then the byte itself is transfered
 to the destination buffer.

Data bytes that have the high bit already set and are unique in the input
 stream are represented as a Run Length of 1 (ie 81 which includes high bit)
 followed by the data byte.

If your original uncompressed data contains few consecutive bytes and most
have high bit set (ie have values > 127) then your so called
compressed data would require up to 2x the space of the uncompressed data,
so be aware that the compression ratio is extremely variable depending on the
type of data being compressed.

Apologies for this poor attempt at a description, but you can look up
RLE in any good text. Alternatively, any text that describes the PCX file
structure in any depth should have a section on RLE compression.

  ------------
  C Prototype:

  void x_triangle(int x0, int y0, int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2,
         WORD color, WORD PageBase);

  This function draws a filled triangle which is clipped to the current
  clipping window defined by TopClip,BottomClip,LeftClip,RightClip.
  Remember: the X clipping variable are in BYTES not PIXELS so you
    can only clip to 4 pixel byte boundaries.


  x_polygon

  This function is similar to the triangle function but draws
  convex polygons. The vertices are supplied in the form of a FAR
  pointer.

  NOTE: a convex polygon is one such that if you draw a line from
  any two vertices, every point on that line will be within the
  polygon.

  This function works by splitting up a polygon into its component
  triangles and calling the triangle routine above to draw each one.
  Performance is respectable but a custom polygon routine might be
  faster.

    xfill.h


  EXPORT FUNCTIONS


  x_flood_fill
  ------------
  C Prototype:

  int x_flood_fill(int x, int y, unsigned ofs, int color);

  This function performs the familiar flood filling used by many
  paint programs and of course the Borland BGI's flood fill function.
  The pixel at x,y and all adjacent pixels of the same color are filled
  to the new color. Filling stops when there are no more adjacent pixels
  of the original pixel's color. The function returns the number of
  pixels that have been filled.

  x_boundary_fill
  ------------
  C Prototype:


  int x_boundary_fill(int x,int y,unsigned ofs,int boundary,int color);

  This function is a variant of the flood fill described above. This
  function, unlike the above function, can fill across color boundaries.
  Filling stops when the area being filled is fully enclosed by pixels
  of the color "boundary". Again, this function returns the number of
  pixels filled.

                               VSYNC

            Simulated Vertical Retrace Interrupt Module

            by Tore Jahn Bastiansen <toreba@ifi.uio.no>

     Inspired by REND386 v3.01 by Dave Stampe and Bernie Roehl

The xvsync module uses timer 0 to simulate a vertical retrace interrupt.
It's designed to significantly reduce the idle waiting time in Xlib.
Why simulate the VRT interrupt ? Simply because a true VRT interrupt is
not implemented on many VGA cards. Using a VRT interrupt as opposed to
polling, can result in huge performance improvements for your code and
help make animation much smoother than it would be using polling.

Normally xlib waits for vsync when x_page_flip, x_set_start_address or
x_put_pal_??? is called. This waiting period could be better utilized to do
housekeeping calculations or whatever. The x_put_pal_??? functions also
doesn't work very smoothly in conjunction with other functions that wait for
the vertical retrace since each function introduces its own VRT delay.

When using the vsync handler, the VRT delay is reduced to the absolute
minumum which can result in a huge performance boost for your programs.

When using double buffering, you may still have to wait before drawing,
but you could do as much other work as possible, like this:

        x_page_flip(...)
        ...
        <animate the palette>
        <do some collision detection and 3D calculations>
        <read the joystick>
        ...
        x_wait_start_address(); (Not needed with triple buffering)
        ...
        <draw next frame>
        ...

ASM SOURCES

C HEADER FILE

  xvsync.h

EXPORTED VARIABLES

VsyncPeriod - WORD -time in 1.193 us between two vsyncs

TicksPerSecond - WORD - number of vsyncs per second

VsyncTimerInt - long - number of vsyncs since x_install_vsync_handler was
     called. Nice for game timing.

EXPORTED FUNCTIONS

x_install_vsync_handler
-----------------------

C Prototype:   void x_install_vsync_handler(int VrtsToSkip);

This function installs the vsync handler using timer 0. It's called
about 100 microseconds before every vertical retrace.

The VrtsToSkip value (>=1) defines the delay in VRT's between consecutive
physical screen start address changes, thus allowing you to limit the
maximum frame rate for page flips in animation systems. The frame rate
is calculated as Vertical refresh rate / VrtsToSkip, eg for
320x240 mode which refreshes at 60Hz a VrtsToSkip value of 3 will result
in a maximum page flipping rate of 20Hz (frames per second)

WARNING:  Be sure to remove it before exiting.
          When used with a debugger, the system clock may speed up.

x_remove_vsync_handler
----------------------

C Prototype:   void x_remove_vsync_handler

This routine _MUST_ be called before exiting (or aborting) the program,
or your system will crash.

x_set_user_vsync_handler
------------------------

C Prototype:   void x_set_user_vsync_handler(void far (*f)());

Installs a user routine to be called once each vertical retrace. The user
handler have its own stack of 256 bytes , so be careful with the stack
checking option in BC.
WARNING: This installs an interrupt driven handler, beware of the following:
         Only 8086 registers are preserved. If you're using 386 code, save
         all the 386 regs.
         Don't do any drawing.
         Don't call any DOS functions.

So why use it?
Well, you can update global variables if you're careful. And it's nice for
palette animation. You can even do fades while loading from disk. You
should use this instead of installing your own int08h routine and chain
to the original.

x_wait_start_addr
-----------------

C Prototype:   void x_wait_start_addr(void)

You must call this function before drawing after a call to x_set_start_addr
or x_page_flip when you are using the vsync handler and not using
triple buffering.

TripleBufferActive - WORD - Indicates whether triple-buffering is on.
     Set by x_triple_buffer.

StartAddressFlag - WORD - This flag is set if there is a new start
     address waiting to be set by the vsync handler.

WaitingStartLow - WORD -  Needed by vsync handler. Keep off.
WaitingStartHigh - WORD - Needed by vsync handler. Keep off.
WaitingPelPan - WORD -    Needed by vsync handler. Keep off.

VsyncPaletteStart - WORD - Start index of video DAC register to be
     updated next vsync. Set by palette functions.

VsyncPaletteCount - WORD - Number of palette entries to be outed next
     vsync. Set by palette functions.

VsyncPaletteBuffer - BYTE[768] - Buffer containing values for the next
     update of the DAC.

EXPORTED FUNCTIONS

x_triple_buffer
----------------

C Prototype:   void x_triple_buffer(WORD PageHeight);

This function behaves like x_double_buffer, but when used with
x_install_vsync_handler you can draw immediately after a page flip.
When x_page_flip is called, VisiblePageOffs is set to the page that
will be display next vsync. Until then, WaitingPageOffs will be displayed.
You can draw to HiddenPageOffs .

WHAT IS MODE X ?
----------------

Mode X is a derrivative of the VGA's standard mode 13h (320x200 256 color).
It is a (family) of undocumented video modes that are created by tweaking
the VGA's registers. The beauty of mode X is that it offers several
benefits to the programmer:
 - Multiple graphice pages where mode 13h doesn't allowing for page flipping
   (also known as double buffering) and storage of images and data in
   offscreen video memory
 - A planar video ram organization which although more difficult to program,
   allows the VGA's plane-oriented hardware to be used to process pixels in
   parallel, improving performance by up to 4 times over mode 13h

   See issue 178-179 of D.D.J. for a full description of VGA's Mode X.

WHAT IS A SPLIT SCREEN ?
------------------------

A split screen is a neat hardware feature offered by the EGA and VGA video
cards. A split screen is a mode of graphics operationin which the Hardware
splits the visual graphics screen horizontally and treats both halves as
individual screens each starting at different locations in video RAM.

The bottom half (which is usually referred to as the split screen) always
starts at address A000:0000 but the top half's starting address is user
definable.

The most common application of split screens in games is the status display
in scrolling games. Split screens make this sort of game simpler to program
because when the top half window is scrolled the programmer does not have to
worry about redrawing the bottom half.

WHAT IS DOUBLE BUFFERING ?
--------------------------

Double buffering (also known as page flipping) is the technique most often
used to do animation. it requires hardware that is capable of displaying
multiple graphics pages (or at least 2). Animation is achieved by drawing
an image in the non visible screen and then displaying the non visible
screen. Once the page has been flipped the process starts again. The next
frame of the animation is drawn on the non visible screen, the page is
flipped again etc.


WHAT IS TRIPPLE BUFFERING ?
--------------------------

Triple buffering is similar to double buffering in many ways, but it
relies on 3 pages being defined for animation. The main selling point
of triple buffering is that it eliminates the need to wait for the
vertical retrace to flip pages before drawing on the new page thus
alowing the programmer to start building the next animation frame
immediately after completing the current one. Heres how it works:

With double buffering, once you complete drawing the hidden page and
youre ready to flip pages, you have to wait for the VGA hardware to
actually flip the page (during the vertical retrace) before you start
drawing the next page otherwise you will be drawing on the visible page.

With triple buffering you cycle between three pages, thus the page you
draw on is guaranteed not to be visible. I know this is a poor
description but it really is quite simple

Triple buffering can acheive the fastest possible animation under the
right conditions but the draw back is that more video RAM is required. If
you wish to store bitmaps in video ram such as background tiles, double
buffering would be the better alternative.


WHAT IS MODE X ?
----------------

Mode X is a derrivative of the VGA's standard mode 13h (320x200 256 color).
It is a (family) of undocumented video modes that are created by tweaking
the VGA's registers. The beauty of mode X is that it offers several

   offscreen video memory
 - A planar video ram organization which although more difficult to program,
   allows the VGA's plane-oriented hardware to be used to process pixels in
   parallel, improving performance by up to 4 times over mode 13h
