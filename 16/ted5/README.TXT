Ted 5.0
=======

The Ted source code needs to be compiled with Borland C/C++ 3.1.  It will
probably compile with 4.0 but there are a few OBJ's that are linked in and
not built (the vgapalette, the tedfont etc.).

This code was written by John Romero of Id Software Inc.  A screen blanker
was added and a scrolling bug was fixed by Mark Dochtermann of Apogee
Software Ltd.

Do not contact Apogee or id regarding any questions on this software.  It
is provided "AS IS" with no warranty.
