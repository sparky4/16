TED 5.0 Features
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

__ Handles all current tile types with ease of expansion for future sizes.
   Current sizes are: 8x8,16x16,32x32. Only one tile size is permitted per
   map set.

__ Handles any amount of tiles that will fit in EMS memory. If EMS is not
   present, you can't use TED 5.0!

__ Handles masked and non-masked tiles.

__ Each map has 3 planes: background tiles, foreground tiles, and extra
   info. The extra info plane will blit icons for values 0-63 (?), higher
   values will be printed as hex. Planes will be selected upon project
   creation.

__ Must have ability to turn on/off each individual plane so all planes
   can be on or off at once.

__ Video modes supported will be CGA 320x200, EGA 320x200/640x480/800x600,
   VGA 320x200 256-color.

__ Map Morph feature will allow user to select a block area and make snap-
   shots of it, modify the area, make another snapshot, etc. until the
   morph process is completed. Full editing capabilities will include:
   DELETE FRAME, INSERT FRAME, MAKE SNAPSHOT.

__ TileInfo feature will allow user to edit tile attributes. Editing capa-
   bilities will include: ADD, DELETE, CHANGE NAME.
