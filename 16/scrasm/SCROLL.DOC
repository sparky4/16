  There, now that I have the hype outta the way, let me explain what
this program is.  I'm releasing the source code to my 4-way scrolling
code so that others can learn from it.  There aren't enough really
good resources out there for someone learning to program games, so I'm
trying to do my part to help.

WHAT IT IS:

  The code is 100% assembly, for which I use MASM 6.0, so there may
be a few problems converting to Turbo Assembler.  I also use the ".386"
directive, meaning that you can't run this code with a 286 or earlier.
But most of the code should be easily convertible.  I haven't been
programming for 386's much so I really don't make the use of the 386
registers like I could have.  Mostly I just did it for some extra 386
instructions.

  You'll need a VGA which can support mode 13h, the MCGA mode.  This
code runs in "tweaked" MCGA mode, or what is called "Mode X".  For more
information on Mode X, check out the 1991 - 1992 issues of Doctor Dobbs
Journal, wherein you will find Michael Abrash's excellent Graphics
Programming column.  This is where I (and many others) found out about
Mode X, which is an excellent graphics mode for fast 256-color graphics.
Also, you can take a look at XLIB, YakIcons, FastGraph, etc which are all
graphics libraries (public domain or otherwise) which support Mode X
graphics and probably have some good documentation on programming the mode.
Additionally, check out _The Programmer's Guide to the EGA and VGA Cards_,
by Richard Ferraro, and _Power Graphics Programming_ (out of print, but
available directly from Que Books) by Michael Abrash.  Finally, you can
ask about graphics programming on many newsgroups such as
"rec.games.programmer"...

WHAT IT DOES:

  The code will allow you to create "tiled" background patterns and then
to omnidirectionally scroll over them.  You could implement sprite routines
and then animate them over the background, but I haven't gotten this far
yet.  The scrolling is always relational -- ie no "jump-to"'s, just "scroll
left", "scroll up", etc.  Jump to would be very easy to implement, I just
haven't done it yet.

  It runs at about 60-70 fps on a 386/20, which means that it is operating
in under the time of one vertical refresh (_just_ under, according to some
timing I've done).  This could probably be reduced, but the best way to
reduce it is to limit the speed at which it scrolls -- if you stick to
scrolling at most 8 pixels at a time in two axes or 16 pixels at a time
in one axis, it is very fast.  More than that, and it occasionally takes
more than one refresh period even on my 486.  Still, that should be
fast enough for just about any game.

  I also included some routines to generate maps, tiles, and palettes
so you can see the file formats.  These are in C, and the executables
are around in case you don't care to recompile.  None of the utilities
are exactly production quality.  You'll have to look at the code to
figure out the arguments!  Luckily you can just run them with no args
and they perform default behavior.

  Lastly, the program SCROLL.EXE is a demo of what it can do.  In this
demo you can use one of two sets of keyboard controls to scroll around.
One, the default set of commands, lets you press up/down/left/right and
scroll in that direction.  The other has "intertia" -- pressing up/down
left/right will accelerate you in that direction.  You'll see what I
mean, just experiment.  You can switch keyhandlers by pressing K.
You can also switch between the diagonal pattern map and a logo map
by pressing M.  (By the way, it will eventually run out of memory loading
the maps and the diagonal map will screw up... don't worry about it,
it'd be fixed if I had more time).  Try it out.

  Obviously I haven't just pirated the code, it's all from publicly
released source code and I modified it a bit.  But I wouldn't have come
up with this whole thing without those helping hands.  Thanks.

HOW IT WORKS:

  Here's how the scrolling works.  I'll explain it from a single-page
point of view, although it actually uses several pages of video memory.
The video memory is laid out like this:
ÉÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÑÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ» ÄÄÄ

In other words, it has a virtual width greater than the actual screen
width, and a virtual height higher than the actual screen height.  The
VGA hardware allows hardware panning around within the virtual area, so
that makes panning much easier:  you only have to draw the information
that is coming on to the screen with each pan.

  The same works up&down too, or even left/right and up/down at the same
time.  The problem occurs when you scroll enough to hit the edge of the
virtual space.  Luckily, video memory increases and wraps at the right
edge to one line down on the left edge.  So you end up with a situation
like this after scrolling too far right:
ÉÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÑÍÍÍÍ» ÄÄÄ

ÈÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ¼ ÄÄÄ
The wrapping is transparent to the user.  So, it appears that you can
scroll left & right infinitely, by simply always updating the amount of
memory that has scrolled into view.

  But what happens when you scroll too far down?  Now Intel segments come
to the rescue!  Because the video memory is 64K, and that is also the
largest amount of memory you can access in a segment, the segment arithmetic
performs the top-to-bottom wrapping for me.  It results in a similar
situation as is pictured above, but with the screen split horizontally
instead of vertically.  Again, it's completely transparent to the user.

  One performance optimization that I've done is to organize the background
picture that is being scrolled into quantitized "tiles" -- 16x16 pixels in
area.  This means that you can store a large amount of picture data if that
data is repetitive -- as the backgrounds of many video games are.  This also
helps when figuring out how much new stuff to draw on the screen.  I can wait
until the panning crosses a 16-pixel border, then draw another 16-pixel
strip, and then wait for another tile crossing, etc.  You can see this in
the MAP.INC and SCROLL.INC code.  16x16 pixels also leads to 256-pixel-square
tiles, which is always a convenient number in assembly... it helps out in
several places in the code.

  So, the display page is "wandering" around the video memory, only drawing
what is necessary at any time.  Meanwhile you can animate sprites over the
background, etc.  The only problem is that with one page, information is
constantly being drawn to that page and you can never guarantee that it is in
a correct state at the time of a vertical refresh period.  Instead, I actually
use several pages, so that one can be shown while the other is worked on.
This guarantees a perfect picture at any time.  So for now, let's ignore the
scrolling for a second, and talk about the paging, because it's easier to
understand the paging if scrolling isn't happening.

  Here's a basic explanation of how the paging works.  I use three separate
pages, a Draw page, a Show page, and a Blank page.  The Show page refers to
the page that is currently showing, the Draw page to the page that is
under construction (to be shown next frame), and the Blank page should always
be maintained as an up-to-date blank background page.  (The Blank page is
useful for sprite programming which I am going to be doing next.)  Each
of the pages is 352x240, although the screen resolution is only 320x200.

  Each frame, the pages rotate DrawPage->ShowPage->BlankPage->DrawPage.
This means that at the beginning of the frame, the Draw Page is already
blank, so all that is necessary is to draw on a bunch of sprites.  The
BlankPage, though, is no longer blank (it's still got stuff from what
was the ShowPage) so we have to erase it, by blanking out the sprites
(luckily the new DrawPage _is_ empty, so we can use a Mode X 32-bit video-
to-video copy to blank it).  Hope you're still with me.

  So, this loop continues with each frame, and the loop invariants are
maintained:  Show Page is always a "good" frame -- don't touch it.  Blank
Page is always blank.  Draw Page can look like anything.  Now to include
the scrolling again:

  The way I do scrolling with several pages is that the pages ALL wander
around video memory, only they're smaller (1/3 of the size that they could
have been, to be exact!).  Here's a picture of the situation at its worst:
ÉÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ» ÄÄÄ

º  ³//³ (Blank)º  ³
ÈÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍÍ¼ ÄÄÄ
The pages always maintain an equal distance apart as they wander.  Since
all pages move in parallel, the way it used to work is that as soon as the
pages scrolled, I would draw the newly-visible picture information on
all three of the pages.  This worked great, except that it resulted in
a slight pause every time the screen scrolled because it was doing hardware
pan most of the time (which is very fast) and the drawing routines were
slow.  Now, I've spread the copying over successive frames to allow a
smoother scrolling rate.  This is possible because it's not really necessary
to draw the new information to a page before that page becomes the show
page...

  I hope that this has made some sense.  It's pretty complicated stuff.
Take a look at the code and maybe that will help.  Or, write me mail
(my email address is below).  Or, design your own way and ignore this
whole thing.

COMING SOON:

  Next up are Sprite routines.  I threw in what I started as SPRITE.INC,
although it's not included in the project right now.

  This code is being released as "SwapWare".  That means that if you wanted
to go ahead and use my code directly, I really wouldn't care.  But I ask
that you send me some of your code that you think is neat.  Especially if
it's modifications that you make to this code, such as quick sprite drawing
or optimizations.

  I'm not going to brag and say that I "threw this together in a few hours".
I didn't, it took me many days of work to get it working properly.  But
I'm also not looking for money as recompensation for my labor.  I make
great money at my real day job and you probably have a better use for your
donations, such as legitimizing your unregistered shareware and pirated
games.  I'm in this for the knowledge ... so my best payback would be to
get lots of code from people out there, stuff to really help make a great
game.  In particular, these would be great:
        * 32-bit code
        * Tricky optimizations
        * Fast BitBlt/masked BitBlt code
        * Useful File I/O functions
        * 3D polygon and texture mapping code
        * Maintenance routines -- like numeric conversions, etc.
        * Hardware access code like timing routines and interrupt
          handlers
Any of those would be very helpful when writing a fast scrolling game.
