 * LIB.C v1.2a
 *
 * by Robert Schmidt
 * (C)1993 Ztiff Zox Softwear
 *
 * Simple graphics library to accompany the article
 * 
 *                                      INTRODUCTION TO MODE X.
 * 
 * This library provides the basic functions for initializing and using
 * unchained (planar) 256-color VGA modes.  Currently supported are:
 *
 *      - 320x200
 *      - 320x240
 *
 * Functions are provided for:
 *
 *      - initializing one of the available modes
 *      - setting the start address of the VGA refresh data
 *      - setting active and visible display pages
 *      - writing and reading a single pixel to/from video memory
 *
 * The library is provided as a demonstration only, and is not claimed
 * to be particularly efficient or suited for any purpose.  It has only
 * been tested with Borland C++ 3.1 by the author.  Comments on success
 * or disaster with other compilers are welcome.
 *
 * This file is public domain.  Do with it whatever you'd like, but
 * please don't distribute it without the article.
 *
 * Thanks go out to various helpful netters who spotted the 0xE7 bug
 * in the set320x240x256() function!
 *
 * Modified by sparky4 so it can be compiled in open watcom ^^

HORIZONTAL SCROLLING
--------------------
Horizontal scrolling is essentially the same as vertical scrolling, all
you do is increment or decrement the VGA offset register by 1 instead of
80 as with vertical scrolling.

However, horizontal scrolling is complicated by two things

  1. Incrementing the offset register by one actually scrolls by FOUR
     pixels (and there are FOUR planes on the VGA, what a coincidence)

  2. You can't draw the image off the screen and then scroll it on
     because of the way the VGA wraps to the next row every 80 bytes
     (80 bytes * 4 planes = 320 pixels), if you tried it, you would
     actually be drawing to the other side of the screen (which is
     entirely visible)

I'll solve these problems one at a time.

Firstly, to get the VGA to scroll by only one pixel you use the horizontal
pixel panning (HPP) register. This register resides at

  PORT:     3C0H
  INDEX:    13h

and in real life, you use it like this

----------------- Pixel Panning ---------------
IN PORT 3DAH (this clears an internal
  flip-flop of the VGA)
OUT 13H TO PORT 3C0H
OUT value TO PORT 3C0H (where "value" is the
  number of pixels to offset)
-----------------------------------------------

/*To implement smooth horizontal scrolling, you would do the following:
-------------- Horizontal Scrolling ------------
FOR X = 0 TO 319 DO
  SET HPP TO ( X MOD 4 )
  SET VGA OFFSET TO ( X/4 )
END FOR
------------------------------------------------

Okay, no problem at all (although I think you might have to fiddle
around with the HPP a bit to get it right...try different values and
see what works :).

So, the next problem is with drawing the images off the screen where
they aren't visible and then scrolling them on!!! As it turns out,
there's yet ANOTHER register to accomplish this. This one's called the
offset register (no, not the one I was talking about before, that one
was actually the "start address" register) and it's at

  PORT:     3D4H/3D5H
  OFFSET:   13H

and here's how to use it

-------------- Offset Register ---------------
OUT 13H TO PORT 3D4H
OUT value TO PORT 3D5H
----------------------------------------------

Now, what my VGA reference says is that this register holds the number
of bytes (not pixels) difference between the start address of each row.
So, in X-mode it normally contains the value 80 (as we remember,
80 bytes * 4 planes = 320 pixels). This register does not affect the
VISIBLE width of the display, only the difference between addresses on
each row.

When we scroll horizontally, we need a little bit of extra working space
so we can draw off the edge of the screen.

Perhaps a little diagram will clarify it. The following picture is of a
standard X-mode addressing scheme with the OFFSET register set to 80.

        ROW    OFFSET
        0        0 ========================
        1       80 [                    ]
        2        160 [                  ]
        ..       .. [    VISIBLE        ]
                  [     SCREEN  ]
                  [                     ]
                  [                     ]
        ..       .. [                   ]
        199   15920 ========================

and the next diagram is of a modified addressing scheme with the OFFSET
register set to 82 (to give us 4 extra pixels on each side of the screen)

Beautiful!!!

As with vertical scrolling, however, you still have the problem of when
you reach the bottom of page 4...and it's fixed in the same manner.

I haven't actually managed to get infinite horizontal scrolling working,
but the method I have just stated will give you a horizontal scrolling
range of over 200 screens!!!! So if you need more (which is extremely
unlikely), figure it out yourself.


------------------
COMBINED SCROLLING
------------------
To do both horizontal and vertical scrolling, all you have to do is combine
the two methods with a few little extras (it's always the way isn't it).

You have to start off with the original screen on the current page and the
next page as well. When you scroll horizontally, you have to draw the edge
that's coming in to the screen to BOTH pages (that means you'll be drawing
the incoming edge twice, once for each page). You do this so that when you
have scrolled vertically down through a complete page, you can jump back
to the first page and it will (hopefully) have an identical copy, and you
can then continue scrolling again.

I'm sorry about this being so confusing but it's a bit difficult to explain.
